# BattleshipStateTracker
BattleshipStateTracker Classic Game

The task is to implement a Battleship state-tracker for a single player that must support
the following logic:
● Create a board
● Add a battleship to the board (meeting the constraints of the game rules) ● Take an
“attack” at a given position, and report back whether the attack resulted in a hit or a
miss
● Return whether the player has lost the game yet (i.e. all battleships are sunk
according to the game rules)
